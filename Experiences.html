<center><h1>Experiences</h1></center>

<h1></h1>
<p>Throughout my middle and high-school years, I have had a lot of experiences. As you know, ever since 7th grade, I have been not only learned how to code a website, but also how to set up a portfolio with information about me. <br /><br />I have also learned leadership and team building through both my scouting life and through my robotics team. In my robotics team and through my engineering teacher Mr. Bottelier I have also learned about engineering principles and how to apply them in the real world. <br />I have learned how to effectively design different thing and the importance of planning. <br /><br />But engineering wasnt the only subject I was interested in. over the last 2 years, with Mr. pants help, I have also learned about the process of game design, and general 3d modeling through blender.
