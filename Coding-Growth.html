			<h1> welcome to my Coding Growth page</h1>
			
				
				<p>Over the years of going to stem I have learned alot about coding. my 7th and 8th grade years were spent testing out a new way of making our digital portfolio's, 
				by hand coding them. in these two years we spent alot of time learning some of the basic and mroe complex things we could do with HTML, and some of it limitations.
				During my highschool years we mostly just had a few new requirements tacked on and had to simply update our pages to reflect how we've grown over the years.
				This year for my coding growth page I decided to put this paragraph here to sum up my experiences rather then have a bunch of uncomprehensable charts and tables taking up the page.</p>
